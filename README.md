## Launch Local Resources
You can launch a http server on your PC to visit these resources quickly.
- *1. Suppose your local installation directory of JSDK is <code>{JSDK-INSTALL}</code>.*
- *2. Run a http server and set your server path <code>http://localhost/jsdk/</code> to pointer to your <code>{JSDK-INSTALL}</code>.*
- *3. Open your browser and visit the URL.*

## Basic knowledge 
JSDK 2.0 was written in <code>ES6</code> and <code>TypeScript 2.0+</code>.

You should have these following basic knowledge before using JSDK:
> ES6 core features : class definition / multiline string / arrow function / new native APIs / Promise etc.
>
> TypeScript 2.0+ syntax and compilation parameters.
>
> VSCode: installation, configuration, creation and compilation of projects.

*Remarks*
* *If you only use JSDK in ordinary JS projects, you do not need to learn TypeScript and VSCode.*
* *It is <b>strongly recommended to use JSDK in TS projects</b>, which will make all features of JSDK effective.*
* *If you need to run JSDK on a browser that does not support ES6, please use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/).*
